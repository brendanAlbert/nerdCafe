    I spent more than FIVE HOURS trying to convert the gui_manager to the OOP paradigm.
    The `theme` being used to provide the look of the buttons
    and tabs just would not cooperate when I tried to make the frame
    and the tabs into objects.  I am sure it can be done but we ran out of time.
    I don't want to mess with it anymore and risk breaking something.
    Since ttk from tkinter is such a relatively esoteric framework, there
    weren't any sources I could find to help fix the particular error that kept
    appearing.  I tried several work-arounds but no dice.
    
    The GUI works if we just import the file from a giant procedural pile of spaghetti.
